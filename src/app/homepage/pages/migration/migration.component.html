  <h3>Migration guide</h3>
  <p>
    This article provides a set of <strong>guidelines</strong> to migrate from 4 to latest 5 version.
    During the development, we spent a lot of time trying to avoid any breaking changes.
    Nevertheless, the API had to change in a bunch of places in order to simplify its usage.
    Also, the previous version has been limited due to decisions that have been made at the very early stage.
    Now, we are less opinionated and even more powerful than before. 
  </p>
  <h4>Modules</h4>
  <p>
    In order to decrease the number of differences between Nest and <a href="https://angular.io/" target="blank">Angular</a>,
    few changes have been made regarding <code>@Module()</code> decorator.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>modules</code> property is now deprecated. Use <code>imports</code> instead</li>
    <li><code>components</code> property is now deprecated. Use <code>providers</code> instead</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Decorators</h4>
  <p>
    The <code>@Component()</code>, <code>@Middleware()</code>, <code>@Interceptor()</code>, <code>@Pipe()</code>, and <code>@Guard()</code> are deprecated now.
    Use <code>@Injectable()</code> instead.
  </p>
  <h4>Middleware interfaces</h4>
  <p>
    The <code>MiddlewaresConsumer</code> class has been changed to <code>MiddlewareConsumer</code>.
    Also, the <code>ExpressMiddleware</code> no longer exists, use <code>MiddlewareFunction</code> interface instead.
  </p>
  <h4>Filters</h4>
  <p>
    The exception filters aren't locked in as single-paradigm anymore.
    Previously, an exception filter had an access to the <code>response</code> object.
    Together with an incoming release, <code>catch()</code> method takes <code>ArgumentsHost</code> instance instead.
    This object is well described <a routerLink="/exception-filters">here</a>.
    Thanks to that, you have an access to each argument, including <code>response</code> object.
  </p>
  <span class="filename">
    <app-tabs #filtersT></app-tabs>
  </span>
  <pre [class.hide]="filtersT.isJsActive"><code class="language-typescript">{{ filters }}</code></pre>
  <pre [class.hide]="!filtersT.isJsActive"><code class="language-typescript">{{ filtersJs }}</code></pre>
  <h4>Guards</h4>
  <p>
    The same as filters, guards are far more <strong>flexible</strong> now. An access to the enhanced <code>ExecutionContext</code> (<a routerLink="/guards">read more</a>) gives guards more superpowers and all of that has been built on top of simplified API.
  </p>
  <span class="filename">
    <app-tabs #guardsT></app-tabs>
  </span>
  <pre [class.hide]="guardsT.isJsActive"><code class="language-typescript">{{ guards }}</code></pre>
  <pre [class.hide]="!guardsT.isJsActive"><code class="language-typescript">{{ guardsJs }}</code></pre>
  <h4>Interceptors</h4>
  <p>
    The interceptors API evolved in the exact same way as <strong>equivalent</strong> guards API.
  </p>
  <span class="filename">
    <app-tabs #interceptorsT></app-tabs>
  </span>
  <pre [class.hide]="interceptorsT.isJsActive"><code class="language-typescript">{{ interceptors }}</code></pre>
  <pre [class.hide]="!interceptorsT.isJsActive"><code class="language-typescript">{{ interceptorsJs }}</code></pre>
  <h4>Custom decorators</h4>
  <p>
    The <code>createRouteParamDecorator()</code> function is deprecated. Use <code>createParamDecorator()</code> now.
  </p>
  <h4>Node.js</h4>
  <p>
    We follow the Node.js release schedule which recently moved to <code>8.x</code> as an active <strong>LTS</strong> version. 
    Therefore, Nest 5 supports >= <code>8.9.0</code> as the lowest version now.
    This shift gaves us sustainable performance boosts thanks to the <code>es2017</code> target of the TypeScript compilation.
  </p>
  <h4>External libraries</h4>
  <p>
    Nest 5 doesn't support <a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs">rxjs</a> < 6.0.0. Keep in mind to upgrade this package as well.
