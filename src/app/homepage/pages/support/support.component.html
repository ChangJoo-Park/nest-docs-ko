  <h3>Support</h3>
  <p>
    Nest is an MIT-licensed open source project with its ongoing development made possible thanks to the support by the community. 
    This framework is a result of the long road, full of sleepless nights, working <strong>after hours</strong>, and busy weekends. 
  </p>
  <p>  
    Nest doesn't have a large company that sits behind and is continuously paying for hours spent on the development.
    I fully rely on the <strong>goodness</strong> ❤️ of the people.
    However, I would love to make this framework even more <strong>powerful</strong>, to be fully focused on delivering you great solutions that make coding process enjoyable:
    In order to help me, I run few supporting platforms:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>become a backer or sponsor on <a href="https://opencollective.com/nest" target="blank">OpenCollective</a></li>
    <li>use <a href="https://paypal.me/kamilmysliwiec" target="blank">PayPal</a> to send a one-time donation</li>
    <li>or reach me directly: <a href="mailto:mail@kamilmysliwiec.com">mail@kamilmysliwiec.com</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you fell in love with Nest, or you run a business which is using Nest, consider sponsoring its development to ensure that the project which your product relies on is <strong>actively maintained</strong> and improved.
    Also, your support could help me to work more on content that benefits whole Nest community, writing either educational blog posts or recording videos.
