  <h3>Guards & interceptors</h3>
  <p>
    In the GraphQL world, a lot of articles complain how to handle stuff like an <strong>authentication</strong>, or <strong>side-effects</strong> of operations.
    Should we put it inside the business logic? Shall we use a higher-order function to enhance queries and mutations as well, for example, with an authorization logic?
    There's no single answer.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Nest ecosystem is trying to help with this issue using existing features like <a routerLink="/guards">guards</a> and <a routerLink="/interceptors">interceptors</a>.
    The idea behind them is to reduce redundancy and also, supply you with tooling that helps creating well-structured, readable, and consistent applications.
  </p>
  <h4>Usage</h4>
  <p>
    You can use both <a routerLink="/guards">guards</a> and <a routerLink="/interceptors">interceptors</a> in the same fashion as in the simple REST application.
    They act equivalently until the <code>request</code> is passed as a <code>rootValue</code> in the <code>graphqlExpress</code> middleware.
    Let's have a look at the following code:
  </p>
  <span class="filename"><app-tabs></app-tabs></span>
  <pre><code class="language-typescript">{{ useGuardsExample }}</code></pre>
  <p>
    Thanks to that you can move your authentication logic to the guard, or even reuse the same guard class as in the REST application.
    The interceptors works in the exact same way:
  </p>
  <span class="filename"><app-tabs></app-tabs></span>
  <pre><code class="language-typescript">{{ useInterceptorsExample }}</code></pre>
  <p>
    Write once, use everywhere :)
